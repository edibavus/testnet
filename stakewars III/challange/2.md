# Challenge 002

## Setup your node

##### Install required software & set the configuration
Before you start, you may want to confirm that your machine has the right CPU features. 

```bash
lscpu | grep -P '(?=.*avx )(?=.*sse4.2 )(?=.*cx16 )(?=.*popcnt )' > /dev/null \
  && echo "Supported" \
  || echo "Not supported"
```
> Supported

##### Install developer tools:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git binutils-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libdw-dev libiberty-dev cmake gcc g++ python docker.io protobuf-compiler libssl-dev pkg-config clang llvm cargo
```
#####  Install Python pip:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
##### Set the configuration:

```bash
USER_BASE_BIN=$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin
export PATH="$USER_BASE_BIN:$PATH"
```

##### Install Building env
```bash
sudo apt install clang build-essential make
```

##### Install Rust & Cargo
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
>Press 1 and press enter.

##### Source the environment
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

##### Clone `nearcore` project from GitHub
First, clone the [`nearcore` repository](https://github.com/near/nearcore).

```
git clone https://github.com/near/nearcore
cd nearcore
git fetch
```

Checkout to the commit needed. Please refer to the commit defined in [this file](https://github.com/near/stakewars-iii/blob/main/commit.md). 
```
git checkout <commit>
```

##### Compile `nearcore` binary
In the `nearcore` folder run the following commands:

```
cargo build -p neard --release --features shardnet
```

##### Initialize working directory

In order to work properly, the NEAR node requires a working directory and a couple of configuration files. Generate the initial required working directory by running:

```
./target/release/neard --home ~/.near init --chain-id shardnet --download-genesis
```
This command will create the directory structure and will generate `config.json`, `node_key.json`, and `genesis.json` on the network you have passed. 

##### Replace the `config.json`

```
rm ~/.near/config.json
wget -O ~/.near/config.json https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/shardnet/config.json
```

##### Run the node
To start your node simply run the following command:

```
cd ~/nearcore
./target/release/neard --home ~/.near run
```

The node is now running you can see log outputs in your console. Your node should be find peers, download headers to 100%, and then download blocks.

## Activating the node as validator
##### Authorize Wallet Locally
A full access key needs to be installed locally to be able to sign transactions via NEAR-CLI.


* You need to run this command:

```
near login
```

> Note: This command launches a web browser allowing for the authorization of a full access key to be copied locally.

1 ‚Äì Copy the link in your browser

2 ‚Äì Grant Access to Near CLI

3 ‚Äì After Grant, you will see a page like this, go back to console

4 ‚Äì Enter your wallet and press Enter

#####  Check the validator_key.json
* Run the following command:
```
cat ~/.near/validator_key.json
```


> Note: If a validator_key.json is not present, follow these steps to create one

Create a `validator_key.json` 

*   Generate the Key file:

```
near generate-key <pool_id>
```
<pool_id> ---> xx.factory.shardnet.near WHERE xx is you pool name

* Copy the file generated to shardnet folder:
Make sure to replace <pool_id> by your accountId
```
cp ~/.near-credentials/shardnet/YOUR_WALLET.json ~/.near/validator_key.json
```
* Edit ‚Äúaccount_id‚Äù => xx.factory.shardnet.near, where xx is your PoolName
* Change `private_key` to `secret_key`

> Note: The account_id must match the staking pool contract name or you will not be able to sign blocks.\

File content must be in the following pattern:
```
{
  "account_id": "xx.factory.shardnet.near",
  "public_key": "ed25519:HeaBJ3xLgvZacQWmEctTeUqyfSU4SDEnEwckWxd92W2G",
  "secret_key": "ed25519:****"
}
```

#####  Start the validator node

```
target/release/neard run
```
* Setup Systemd
Command:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/neard.service
```
Paste:

```
[Unit]
Description=NEARd Daemon Service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<USER>
#Group=near
WorkingDirectory=/home/<USER>/.near
ExecStart=/home/<USER>/nearcore/target/release/neard run
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
KillSignal=SIGINT
TimeoutStopSec=45
KillMode=mixed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Note: Change USER to your paths

Command:

```
sudo systemctl enable neard
```
Command:

```
sudo systemctl start neard
```
If you need to make a change to service because of an error in the file. It has to be reloaded:

```
sudo systemctl reload neard
```
###### Watch logs
Command:

```
journalctl -n 100 -f -u neard
```
Make log output in pretty print

Command:

```
sudo apt install ccze
```
View Logs with color

Command:

```
journalctl -n 100 -f -u neard | ccze -A
```
#### Becoming a Validator
In order to become a validator and enter the validator set, a minimum set of success criteria must be met.

* The node must be fully synced
* The `validator_key.json` must be in place
* The contract must be initialized with the public_key in `validator_key.json`
* The account_id must be set to the staking pool contract id
* There must be enough delegations to meet the minimum seat price. See the seat price [here](https://explorer.shardnet.near.org/nodes/validators).
* A proposal must be submitted by pinging the contract
* Once a proposal is accepted a validator must wait 2-3 epoch to enter the validator set
* Once in the validator set the validator must produce great than 90% of assigned blocks

Check running status of validator node. If ‚ÄúValidator‚Äù is showing up, your pool is selected in the current validators list.
