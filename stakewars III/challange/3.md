# Stake Wars: Episode III. Challenge 003

###  Mounting a staking pool
NEAR uses a staking pool factory with a whitelisted staking contract to ensure delegatorsâ€™ funds are safe. In order to run a validator on NEAR, a staking pool must be deployed to a NEAR account and integrated into a NEAR validator node. Delegators must use a UI or the command line to stake to the pool. A staking pool is a smart contract that is deployed to a NEAR account.


##### Deploy a Staking Pool
```bash
near call factory.shardnet.near create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "yourpool", "owner_id": "yourwallet.shardnet.near", "stake_public_key": "check in validator_key.json", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}, "code_hash":"DD428g9eqLL8fWUxv8QSpVFzyHi1Qd16P8ephYCTmMSZ"}' --accountId="yourwallet.shardnet.near" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
```

Done

Unstaking takes 2-3 epochs to complete, after that period you can withdraw in YoctoNEAR from pool.
```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near withdraw '{"amount": "<amount yoctoNEAR>"}' --accountId yourwallet.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```
